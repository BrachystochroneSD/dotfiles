This is a simple implementation of Promises/A+.

This implementation ported the following Promises/A+ implementation faithfully.
https://github.com/then/promise

* The same API as JavaScript version Promise can be used.
 * then, catch, resolve, reject, all, race, etc...
* supports "thenable"
* supports "Inheritance of Promise"
* supports "rejection-tracking"

Usage:
See `promise-examples.el' for details.

 You can check the operation while downloading and running it interactively.

(require 'promise)

Please be sure to enable it when developing.
